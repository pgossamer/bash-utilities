In this project, we got to know each other better and developed basic Bash utilities for working with texts in the C programming language. These utilities (cat and grep) are quite often used when working in a Linux terminal. As part of this project, it was supposed to get acquainted with the organization of Bash utilities and consolidate the structural approach.

Integration tests were written to check the program's operability

to run the program, you need to go to the required directory and write `make` on the command line

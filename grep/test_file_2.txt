Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data,
so that characters that differ only in case match each other.
Although this is straightforward when letters differ in case only via
lowercase-uppercase pairs, the behavior is unspecified in other situations.
For example, uppercase “S” has an unusual lowercase
counterpart “ſ” (Unicode character U+017F, LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S)
in many locales, and it is unspecified whether this unusual character
matches “S” or “s” even though uppercasing it yields “S”.
Another example: the lowercase German letter “ß”
(U+00DF, LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S) is normally capitalized
as the two-character string “SS” but it does not match “SS”,
and it might not match the uppercase letter “ẞ”
(U+1E9E, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S) even though lowercasing
the latter yields the former.
